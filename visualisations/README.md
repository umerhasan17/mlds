Welcome to my portfolio of data science visualisations:

SPY Correlation Heapmap

this is a correlation heatmap of a list of companies in the S&P 500. Clearly each company is perfectly correlated with itself, hence the dark green diagonal. It is very easy to see a few outliers and a few neutral stocks. For example, banks on the whole do not follow the trends occuring in the rest of the market. A reason for this could be their returns are better on average when there is a bear market or when there is a lot of volatility. It was inspired by the sentdex YouTube channel. 

Plot of NYC taxis pickup and dropoff locations

the data for this was gathered from the Kaggle competition which took place in 2018. It was also inspired by the following notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/dynamics-of-new-york-city-animation
